    /**
     * This class handles writing to and from file.
     *
     * The methods are static so they can be called without making an object of
     * the class. If the application is designed with frequent file writing and
     * reading the a non-static method should be used instead.
     *
     *  EXAMPLE OF SAVING TO FILE:       
     *  ArrayList<String> as = new ArrayList<String>();
        as.add("Peter,3,8,12,13");
        as.add("Linda,18,2,4,5");
        as.add("Bob,8,12,4,6");
         
        FileHandlerStat.savePersons(as, "persons.txt");  
        
        EXAMPLE OF LOADING FROM FILE:
        ArrayList<String> outof = new ArrayList<String>();
        outof = FileHandlerStat.load("persons.txt");
        for (String line : outof) {
            System.out.println("Person: " + line);
